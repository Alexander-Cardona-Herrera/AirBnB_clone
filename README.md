## **About the Project**

This project is carried out in order to test the knowledge acquired throughout the months spent at Holberton while seeking to contribute a little more knowledge and experience. In addition to this, develop soft skills in the area of   teamwork, collaborative synergy and problem solving along the way.

It was created looking simple and elegant but at the same time efficiency, following the framework and respecting what Holberton as a "final client" ask us to do.

To make this AirBnB works you have to have in your machine the next files:

                console.py
                models > __init__.py
			             basemodel.py
			             user.py
			             amenity.py
			             city.py
			             place.py
			             state.py
			             review.py
			             engine > __init__.py
						          file_storage.py
                

Also in the same directory you can have the next files if you want to test it:
                
			    tests > __init__.py
		                test_models > __init__.py
							          test_basemodel.py
							          test_user.py
							          test_amenity.py
							          test_city.py
							          test_place.py
							          test_state.py
							          test_review.py
							          test_engine > __init__.py
											        test_file_storage.py
